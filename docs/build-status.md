## Known Issues
1. Photo uploads disabled — deferred until Supabase Pro upgrade
2. `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` and `supabase-schema.md` in `/docs` have Windows filesystem permission issues — not readable via Linux mount (recreate if needed)
3. `supabase/` folder exists in repo root but appears empty — confirm migration files location
4. `New ServiceWindow website/` subfolder exists — confirm if legacy and safe to delete
